//PATH EXTRACTION 

//Given a ray described by an initial point P0 and a direction V both in world coordinates, 
//check to see if it intersects the polygon described by "vertices," an array of vec3
//values describing the location of the polygon vertices in its child frame.
//mvMatrix is a matrix describing how to transform "vertices" into world coordinates
//which you will have to do to get the correct intersection in world coordinates.
//Be sure to compute the plane normal only after you have transformed the points,
//and be sure to only compute intersections which are inside of the polygon
//(you can assume that all polygons are convex and use the area method)
